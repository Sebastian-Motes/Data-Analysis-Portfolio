# Sebastian Motes - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Sebastian Motes! With a strong foundation in applied mathematics and hands-on experience in diverse work environments, I am on a journey to pursue a career in data analysis. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics, and I am eager to apply my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to extract meaningful insights from data. My career goal is to transition into a tech-focused role, where I can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

Throughout my academic journey, I developed an in-depth understanding of complex data analysis and honed my skills in statistics, modeling, and data visualization. I have a natural inclination toward uncovering patterns, optimizing solutions, and communicating findings effectivelyâ€”skills that I believe will be valuable in a data analyst role. My experience as an Area Manager at Amazon has also given me a unique perspective on operational processes, team leadership, and the practical applications of data in driving efficiencies and improvements.

Outside of work, I enjoy expanding my knowledge of data analysis tools and methods, staying current with the latest trends in technology, and refining my skills in data manipulation and visualization. Whether working on individual projects or as part of a team, I find great satisfaction in transforming raw data into actionable insights that contribute to meaningful outcomes.

Feel free to explore my work, projects, and progress in data analytics through my portfolio. My CV is also available [here].
